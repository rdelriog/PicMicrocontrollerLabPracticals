Experiments and lab practicals using a Pic Microcontroller (C language)

This repository contains different experiments and practicals on a PIC microcontroller using C:

1 4 Bits walk: This code turns on LEDs sequentially from left to right and thn turns them off from right to left. A potentiometer regulates the speed.

2 Temperature control: A set point between 0 and 100 is chosen using the push buttons in the circuit. By oushing on the OK button the temperature and set point are shown on the Display. After clicking OK again, the comparison between these values (<, >, =) is shown and a corresponding LED is turned on.

3 Membrane Swicth Keyboard (Matrix Keyboard): The display shows the key pressed and the number of the key.

4 Counter from 0-99: By pressing the asterisc on the keyboard, the limit of the counter can be established (between 0 and 99). Once the asterisc is pressed again the counter starts (and shows it to the display) with a delay of 100 ms between the numbers.
